# Sponsoring Rules and Terms of Services (and usages)

Hi! Thanks for considering to support me.

I added some features to add value to your donation but as you and I aware, people abuse everything if you don't declare the rules beforehand.

For the most part, if you want to learn about a feature or a goal, you must visit it's page.
If I talk about a feature in another page, I should link it.

**If there is a link missing, open an issue, tag and nag about it in [Discord][discord], or better, open a PR!**
**_Hurray for open source!_**

Hey buddy, **if you don't wanna say "why is that like this", you have to read this**.

Take a look at [rules][rules] here.

- [Supporting](#)

## Features

Here are 4 noteworthy features that I _plan_ to provide.
To learn about more of them, visit [the features page][features].
> What do I mean by "_plan_ to provide"? Check this page to learn about [W.I.P. stage][wip]

### Foundation Stone page

Totally decorational but when [the website][website] is ready,
you'll get shown in the foundation pyramid based on your tier.

This means, if you support with higher sponsor tiers, you'll be higher in the pyramid.

[Take a look here for more info.][founding-stone]

### Commission projects and features

You can send me a Twitter DM or an e-mail to discuss about the project you had in your mind.

Just don't forget that I may not accept your project depending on my schedule, my abilities for such project, your budget or amount/complexity of the things you want.

I might give discounts if I like your project enough, you agree to partially or fully open source the project or apply to some other "hidden" criteria.

Commissioned projects don't have to be a new idea/project idea, it can be paid contribution to an open source project. Don't be shy about it.

[For more info, go to this page][commission]

### Commission Bounty

Like other people, I too can suffer from burnout, especially when I work on the same thing for a long time.
Working on other projects helps it, so you can help me by bidding on goal lists.
These goals can be project/feature goals I add for my projects or the very own things [you commissioned](#commission-projects-and-features).
To learn about how the goal lists

Of course, I'm still a human, some things are more interesting than others, so bidding by itself won't make me work on that goal.

You don't use plain money as bid money, instead you use [credits][bid-credits] to place bids.
Also, this feature is subject to [website][website] rules.

Interested? Check out [this page][bidding] for more info.

### Bounty Hunting

Some commissions or commission goals can be set as public bounties.
If you complete these goals and your work gets approved, you'll get the bounty of that goal!

With this, you can both contribute to open source and earn [credits][bid-credits] without using your money.

> To get credits, you either pay up with your labor or you pay with "proof of labor" we call money.

This project is subject to [website][website] rules.
Check out [bounty hunting][questing] for more info.

## Sponsor Bonuses

Sponsor bonuses including but not limited to:

### Discord

When you connect your Discord account with the support account, you can get cosmetics like ranks in [our _offical_ Discord guild][discord].

**You don't need to sponsor** to get in the discord.

### Bonuses on Abrifq's Projects

If you support me during the making of a project or have bidded on the project goal, you may be eligible for bonuses like discounts within project or extras like "added slots" or "bonus project time".

Each project page should have it's Supporter Bonus section.
Once again, if it doesn't and the file is not actively edited, **DM me or open an issue**.

Also, project supporters can get early access (as in closed beta) to state their opinions and test the features out with abusable limits.
Contribute, for humanity first, then for open source. :slightly_smiling_face:
